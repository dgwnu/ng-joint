# To-Do

## Additional Bi-Directional Data Change Logic

Implement multiple flexible add-on ShapeEvent-handlers in ShapeService (already tested)
- refactor StandardRectangle (add bi-directional body and label data functionality)
- refactor UmlShapes (using Event and Change handling...)
- Create test components in App (showing bi-directional Event end Change handling working fine!)

## Check Data Change Logig with Cache Mechanism

When the Data Change Logic works that should also give the ablility to save manual changes of element and link positions, creation and deletion between Tabs, Menu's, Routings and other page Navigation events.
